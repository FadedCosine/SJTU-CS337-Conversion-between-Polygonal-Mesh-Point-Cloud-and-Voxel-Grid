# SJTU-CS337-Conversion-between-Polygonal-Mesh-Point-Cloud-and-Voxel-Grid
For group project of Computer Graph on 3D reconstruct.

In this project, we dive into the problem of conversion between polygonal mesh, point cloud and voxel grid. Given a dataset
of 3D models formatted in .obj/.stl, we implement algorithms that transform these formats into voxel and point cloud representation, and
also algorithms transform the result backward to polygonal mesh. We implement the Greedy Projection Triangulation algrithm and
Marching Cube from scratch without any external libraryâ€™s help, and final obtain a high-quality conversion between 3D models

##  .stl to .obj 
Just put the stl model in stl2obj/, and change the coresponding filename in stl2obj/stl2obj.py , and run it.

## Mesh to Point Cloud
We simply delete all the triangle faces information in the .obj file and then we can get a point cloud model.

## Point Cloud to Mesh
We have tried two ways to convert in GreedyTrangulation/ and Marching Cube/

## Mesh to Voxel & Voxel to Mesh
All the codes are in  Marching Cube/
